# ComfyUI-KeySyncWrapper
WIP implementation of KeySync in ComfyUI

You'll need to git clone the original KeySync code into the folder where this node sits. Then everything should work? Maybe?
```bash
cd ../ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-KeySyncWraper
git clone https://github.com/antonibigata/keysync
```
