# ComfyUI-KeySyncWrapper
WIP implementation of KeySync in ComfyUI

You'll need to git clone the original KeySync code into the KeySyncWrapper folder where this node sits. Then everything should work? Maybe?
Lots of dependencies so beware installation issues. 

Reach out if you can help me clean up the code!

```bash
cd ../ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-KeySyncWraper
git clone https://github.com/antonibigata/keysync
```
